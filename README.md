# cellstatemapping
This repository's purpose is developing a stand alone package which will reveal cancer associated immune cells states with unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Here methods are derived from this paper: Bachireddy, P., Azizi, E., Burdziak, C., Nguyen, V. N., Ennis, C., Maurer, K., Park, C. Y., Choo, Z., Li, S., Gohil, S. H., Ruthen, N. G., Ge, Z., Keskin, D. B., Cieri, N., Livak, K. J., Kim, H. T., Neuberg, D., Soiffer, R. J., Ritz, J., . . . Wu, C. J. (2021). Mapping the evolution of T cell states during response and resistance to adoptive cellular therapy. Cell Reports, 37(6), 109992. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109992 

**Objectives of cellstate_mapping**
- Reproduce the results using non-PCA based, with annotation and interpretation of major common factors.
- Inspect whether the non-responsive patients are driven by common or different resistance mechanisms in datasets.
- Creating a meta-clustering scheme to account for within-cluster variability. 
- The implementation of a GP regression model.
