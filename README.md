# cellstatemapping
This repository's purpose is developing a stand alone _Python_ package which will reveal cancer associated immune cells states with unsupervised machine learning algorithms. 

**Objectives of cellstate_mapping**
- Reproduce the results using non-PCA based, with annotation and interpretation of major common factors.
- Inspect whether the non-responsive patients are driven by common or different resistance mechanisms in datasets.
- Creating a meta-clustering scheme to account for within-cluster variability. 
- The implementation of a GP regression model.
